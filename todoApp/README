This Play! Framework requires Play! v1.1RC2 or better

It demonstrates a simple TodoList application.
I use this project as a demo, I presented this application
at Soft-Shake Geneva 2008.

Try "git tags" to retrieve the list of steps I wrote
to create this application.

Thanks to G.Bort for the Zencontact CSS3 stylesheets
that I adapted to PlayDoo

Enjoy!
